## Order Purchase System
### User Interface
The main page contains two options, to go to place new order, or to see my orders.
In the Place New Order page, there are two options, to go in Category 1, or go in Category 2.
In both the pages, user can scroll through the tabbed views to select objects, 
a toast appears every time the user adds(clicks on it)an object
When the user selects all the objects he wants, he can come back to the Place New Order page and click Purchase.
The Confirm Purchase page opens up, it shows the total amount that will cost the user.
On clicking the confirm purchase button the user is redirected to the main page.
He can visit to the My Orders page to visit his previous orders(currently the app only shows the most recent purchase).
